write a black mirror script about a guy and his girlfriend who bet on sports somewhat regularly and are pretty good at it, and with the end of the world approaching before his eyes, the guy decides to create a "betting on the apocalypse" game, where people put odds on world events happening. it starts out just as kind of trolling the state of the world, and it goes away for a while. and then, all of a sudden, one of the events happens and it causes the site to go viral because people are wondering if money is riding on the event happening. and it turns out there was some crazy action that happened before he was ass*assinated, and billions of dollars were poured in by private equity who orchestrated the k*ll because they are controlling everything and knew it was going to happen
