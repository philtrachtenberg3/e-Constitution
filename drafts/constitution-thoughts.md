Maybe i'll be able to write on GitHub since the VS Code interface is different. it doesn't feel like i have to write perfectly. i can just mess around, like code.

We all need to learn how to code. What are we doing here?

We need to create an online constitution. We have the power of ideas, but we're just yelling at them. We need to out-idea them.

New Constitution starts with... wow honestly we could go back to FDR's 1944 speech on a Second Bill of Rights. Because that's pretty relevant to right now.

## Roosevelt's Speech (from Wikipedia):

 During Roosevelt's January 11, 1944, message to the Congress on the State of the Union, he said the following:[7]

    It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for the winning of a lasting peace and the establishment of an American standard of living higher than ever before known. We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our peopleâ€”whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenthâ€”is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.

    This Republic had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection of certain inalienable political rightsâ€”among them the right of free speech, free press, free worship, trial by jury, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures. They were our rights to life and liberty.

    As our nation has grown in size and stature, howeverâ€”as our industrial economy expandedâ€”these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.

    We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. "Necessitous men are not free men."[8] People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.

    In our day these economic truths have become accepted as self-evident. We have accepted, so to speak, a second Bill of Rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be established for allâ€”regardless of station, race, or creed.

    Among these are:

        The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation;
        The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation;
        The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;
        The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;
        The right of every family to a decent home;
        The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;
        The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;
        The right to a good education.

    All of these rights spell security. And after this war is won we must be prepared to move forward, in the implementation of these rights, to new goals of human happiness and well-being.

    America's own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for all our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.

That's pretty good. Let's go back to that. Now, we've come so far as to always condemn the Nazi's, but apparently be perfectly okay with the actions the Nazi's did. Apparently... 

The Nazi's led people on death runs and shot them if they straggled or fell. Old men. Fathers. 
The Israeli's lead pepole on death runs and shoot them if they straggle or fall. Old men. Fathers.
It's just the tense that changes. The action remains the same.

We must agree on what war crimes are. There must be irrefutables:
- Exploding pagers

Honestly, i think everybody deserves to have a last meal. Their last meal, which they know is their last meal, which they can have whatever they want. It's not fair to end people before they can have what they know is their last meal. Israel does that. Stop doing that. Israel - if you want to murder all 2 million Palestinians, at least do them the courtesy of mass arresting all of them and giving them the final meal that they want. Even if it's their mothers whatever. Let them eat it. Get the ingredients for the mother to make her son's favorite dish one more time before ending the family bloodline. Which has probably been there for hundreds of years. If you're going to do it, stop with the whole plan/quadcopter/AK-47 bit. Create a long table and let people have their final meal. Then, end them and build your utopian Gaza with mansions for the uber-wealthy. "Dubai" in Israel. You did it, you created heaven.

It's all because these f*ckers don't want to go to jail. If they go to jail, all of this gets better. If N*tanyahu and Tr*mp go to jail, and smarter, more peaceful people come into power, the world would be a better place. We need intelligent people in power. Not the idiots. All of these idiots need to go, with the exception of maybe aoc and ilhan and bernie and all those guys. I think they are trying, for as much hate as they (rightfully) get. It's hard. This is a VERY dangerous government right now.

I think in a year we will be looking at:
- martial law
- jailed political opponents
- banned non-Tr*mp news networks
- curfews in major cities
- checkpoints everywhere, especially at schools
- a war with Iran, possibly attacks here
- possibly a nuclear b*mb used
- mass starvation
- mass homelessness
- mass disease
- hospitals overwhelmed

This is so beyond f*cked. We need a new constitution.

We need a digital country too. Think about if we rededicated all our efforts away from wars and debt, and started doing:
- solar 
- figuring out the best ways to mass distribute clean water (who is this dude who figured out clean water? the segway guy?)
- figuring out a digital government. how to have all government services SECURELY online. Blockchain. What if we all learned that?
- figuring out the best ways to grow clean and nutritious food
- stop jailing f*cking everyone

My mind runs so much these days. It's exhausting. I'm just being used so wrong. My energy is not going towards the right places. I need something to focus on. There's so many AI projects to work on, but they all TAKE TIME
- handwriting ocr - interpreting people's handwriting and being able to create a font with it. SUPER dangerous because you can write a letter as if you're someone else and the recipient would never know if the letter was actually written by the person to them. it's like copying someone's fingerprint. So f*cked. Seriously, we need to regulate this stuff. What the actual f*ck.
- smart glasses which use eye movement tracking to tell what you want. tech is so unintuitive these days. like technology in cars is SO distracting. it needs to work with people, not against them
- translation headphones (but like good ones) - these can go on the smart glasses, so if somebody is speaking a different language, you can subtly turn the translator on and it'll translate the conversation for you with different voices based on who's talking. spy shit. we can all have that.

F*ck. New Constitution. Sit and stop and sing. Use music and games. And food. Those are the secrets to connecting everyone. Trmp can't stop us from playing chess and listening to rock. Well, he can. But it'll affect much more than just "the libs".

I f*cking rock this shit. i'm so good at troubleshooting. how do i do that? but i get no fucking credit for it. it's insane. by people who can't open a PDF. I can do so much more. But i'm doing nothing. making nothing. it's embarrassing.

Get your shit together, Phil.

If I am to get out of here, i'm not fully ready. my tech isn't ready. i've known this day would come for so long, and i kept trying to be ready to wipe things, but i'm not there. i'm not even close. i'm not safe. luckily i'm not working for anyone, but i'm close to just incriminating everyone. for nothing. to keep myself sane.

They need a warning label. i should have known what i was getting into. 2 cats and a personality. i can't even say it here. they should have to be up front about it and be like "here's what you're getting into". i guess they did that for some things, but not for the major thing. not for the thing that drives all other things. there's still no acknowledgement. it's like living in a fake reality where we can't acknowledge the real thing going on. and so i avoid and avoid and avoid and avoid. but it makes sense, because it's not safe. nothing is safe here. this isn't normal. but, i've been so private. i can't even say all this stuff. it's just what's on my mind and causing my frustration. i need to get things out, i'm SO pent up. but i keep on just acting like a good little boy who's up for anything, even though i'm really not. like tonight. i'm not excited. is this e-Constitution a journal now? like what the fuck am i doing here? is this going to get shut down? am i going to git push this? can i revert it? maybe. i guess this'll be my practice. jeeeeeez.

i don't think this is real. i don't think any of this is real. there's no way. you can't be so un-integrated that you can't speak up. otherwise you'll just get deported and it'll be the end.

Okay, Constitution writing. Focous.

We need to follow Estonia's lead. Not exactly the same (they made it in the early 2000s, we have the benefit of more knowledge), but the same idea. They have all government services online, so you can go to the hospital and pay taxes and get government forms online. it's all a matter of integrating all services securely. But like you could have the highway systems connected to the cities. And, fucking public transportation!! just build good trains!! it's so easy and obvious. And guess what, "job creators"... IT'S JOBS! BULIDING A TRAIN IS JOBS. Just treat people well. Take your time. Stop capitalisming. 

All i can do is write. i'm so frustrated. and dishonest. the world is ending, so why not try?

Don't you think it's a good idea if people can get from NYC to LA in 5 hours? with trains running multiple times per day? That's what other countries do. the countries we make fun of. They're like: "our people should be able to get across the country easily". But they did it so cheapily. We could do it better. But instead we're letting LA burn and holding fundraisers about it. Like the wildfires are watching us being like "LOL you think money is going to stop this?" It's all Don't Look Up. We're mining the planet for money. What if we used this insane technology we have, and used it to stop climate change! The thing we can ALL AGREE IS HAPPENING! Right? There are ultimate truths in the world? Bmbing people out of existence is sadistic. It's sadistic. There is no value of human life. You cannot say 300 of one life is worth 4 of another life. Human lives aren't math. Killing is bad. 

And then, i'm such a fcking hypocrite. i don't live ANY of these values in my real life. i'm terrified. i'm holding up a sign saying "stop!" while the machine is getting ready to fcking murder me. We all see it coming. it's just a matter if when, not if.

Can i keep writing about Constitution? It's something to focus on.

We need data sovereignty. It means the ability to own your own data and have to grant other people the right to use it. Like, you cannot be compelled to give up your data. It is private to you. Why is privacy so important? Why is it so different from facebook/google/amazon/apple selling all of our data to the highest bidder? What are better things you could do with data? 

You could build this. Google Maps was built by gathering infinite data points about physical surroundings, and getting really good developers to make it intuitive. But, it's a massive company and it has no incentive to really innovate. nobody else is going around the world to gather infinite data points in order to create a new and better map system. One that integrates with VR / glasses, so you're actually integrated with the world rather than fighting against the technology. right now it feels like we're fighting against the technology ALL the time. Every app has its own login and you need to remember each one of them and they need to be long and safe and different from every other password, and you need 2-FA so you always need to have your phone with you. all this just to... be safe. so that someone on the other side of the world DOESN'T take all my sht. i'm paying for the right for them to not extort me. To open fraudulent accounts in my name. it's too easy. it seems too easy. the scamming seems too easy these days, especially as we de-regulate everything. in an ideal world, you'd regulate tech closely because IT'S SCARY WHAT IT CAN DO! Y'ALL WANT CHATGPT ROBOTS? You know they'll push those things out well before their tested. it's all about showing the new cool thing, and not about whether it actually works or has any accountability at all. We build things and let humans be the test subjects (Katy perry cough what the actual fck is happening here we're sending celebrities to space while people starve and burn down here. it's don't look up x1000. in real life).

i can't do this life. i can't. i can't hear another rant about christian zionism. WE DON'T DO ANYTHING. YOU JUST RANT AT ME. AND I CAN'T WALK AWAY. I AM CO-OPTED AND THERE IS NO CONCERN AT ALL YOU WILL NEVER STOP TALKING AND SAYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. This whole thing is insane - do i leave now or do i finish the semester? Will this choice be made for me? probably. am i going to always regret not leaving for good. almost definitely. it's hard to say "stay and fight" when the fight looks like this. it's so dumb. it's protestors going and yelling, and politicians calling the police to stop them. the problem is, the protests have been benign under Supreme Leader so far. They will escalate (even if it's the feds that do it), which will be the excuse for Supreme Leader to call in the military to squash these un-American protestors. And then guess what? You think the military are leaving? Hah! Those boys are staying. They are going to break the THIRD AMENDMENT. Everyone up in arms about the second (which, fck all of you. what a bullsht take), we're about to have the 3rd broken!

You're going to talk to them about it, aren't you. make them make the decision for you again, aren't you. This is sick. this is so unhealthy.

if i stay, i will always be this passive guy. this isn't okay.

here's the black mirror episode: guy and his girlfriend have been betting on sports for a while. guy and girlfriend are both feeling helpless with the state of the world, so they create gambling on world events. things like "us declares war on iran", "martial law in the us". all the way down to thing like "trmp assassinated". and it's fun and games and it gains some traction, and then dies down for a while. and then suddenly trmp gets assassinated and the site goes viral on right wing media, and suddenly everyone is wondering if somebody had gambled on trmp dying. and how much. and it ends up being private equity, because private equity owns everything right now, including who's in office. trmp is nothing compared to them, what they own. he is a pawn, as are we all.

i guess i'm staying. for now.

this isn't going to work. i can't format things in here. and, what the fck am i doing? who am i doing it for? i'm sedentary. i know this is a horrible strategy. i'm public and searchable. this is so bad.

This might be a horrible idea. There's a reason people don't write on GitHub. I don't actually know what i'm doing. anyone can "fork" this and make their own version. But... i guess that's what i'm doing?

i move too fast.

Omg. Let's get back to the second bill of rights:
    - **The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation**: in today's day and age, this probably means the ability to get a job in something that is providing some value, like a shop or a warehouse or an IT profession. some trade that is useful today. definitely a lot more IT, we need IT workers. and plumbers, contractors, etc... stuff like that. no more mines.
    - **The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation**: this makes sense - everyone should have enough food to eat, clothing to wear, and fun to have. I'd add water to this, unless that would be covered somewhere else. this is basically the "bare essentials" category. i'd also include electricity, hot water (in addition to drinking water), and heat/AC (since it is 2025). there are environmental considerations for the heat/AC part, so i could see that getting taken out. but basically: everyone should be able to live comfortably.
        - i think one of the most insane things these days is that people are afraid others have "too much" food, shelter, and fun. as if they are hoarding them, and it is our responsibility to make sure they don't have too much food, shelter, and fun. the thing with these categories is: they regulate themselves. people don't want to be gluttons. and if they are, they'll usually get called out. People don't want to have shopping as the thing that emotionally regulates them. or a status symbol, or whatever. "too much clothing" regulates itself. same with too much fun. as if the poor people are just having so much fun, all the time. fun regulates itself too. there's time to have fun and there's time to be serious. usually that regulates itself too. on a good team, it naturally does. people aren't just needlessly funn-ing all the time. stop making tickets for all events so expensive, TicketMaster. Which we all rely on.
    - The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living;
    - The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad;
    - The right of every family to a decent home;
    - The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;
    - The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment;
    - The right to a good education.

What if this was a rule - if you beat up someone, you have to heal them. is that feasible? the idea that if you're going to injure someone for a moral reason, you should be responsible for healing their injuries. incentivize people to think about it. i don't know. maybe this is too far utopian.

if i were in any time in history, i would just pretend it wasn't happening and ignore it until it comes to my doorstep. that's what's happening. and it feels like it could be any day now.

i feel good because the decision was made for me. but it's a sad decision. it's a decision that was made for me. and it's not the right one. not long term. it's the short term safety. that's what it is.

I need to get her out. i need to get them out. what am i DOING here? has the world gone mad? just bring me back to a simpler time. i'll do better. i'll value myself more.

---

There's too much to write about. And i want to write about it publicly. but i'm too private to be public. i haven't worked on my masculine enough to be public. i haven't worked on my ability to wither storms and have 'strong decisions, loosely held'. I know i can. i know i can be someone people follow. but i keep not trusting myself, and now i'm with the complete opposite: pure feminine. it sucks that the gender roles are so, but they are full-on feelings and emotions. no rationality. right now i'm only living in rationality as a protection because my feelings are too strong. there's too much i can't say. i want to say, but i can't. every investment in the relationship is an investment in the child. it becomes trusting myself. but it feels like if it weren't happening, i'd be objectively better off. i'm fully ready to start a business and work a job. i'm not ready to take care of a baby. i haven't done any research. i'm just existing in my own world. we both are. i've seen the writing on the wall for a while now, and i've seen the 

we're so fucked. we're so fucked. the internet is so insecure. we don't have vpn's and we connect to public wifi's. even our private wifi's aren't secure. i'm just waiting for somebody to take over my computer at any point because it's just some open IP address they see on a wifi network. get me to connect to an evil twin or whatever. It seems so easy? and yet, i'm too afraid to do it. that and QR codes. it's all about finding ways in. but i'm too scared. i won't even bring it up to people. just like REAL PEOPLE IN MY LIFE. 

This isn't a constitution anymore, this is a journal. Back to it, i guess:
    - **The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living**: in 2025, i don't think it needs to be as specific as "a farmer's right to raise and sell for a profit". i think the general idea is that: the people who uphold our society should be able to afford a decent living. the people who grow food, provide healthcare, and teach our kids should be able to earn a decent living. maybe it could even be more simple, as "the people who provide our essentials should be given a good enough salary to live on". That also means like trash collectors, plumbers, electricians. if you provide an "essential service", to which people cannot survive without, you should be able to earn a decent living. that means: food, water, shelter, electricity, healthcare, education.
    - **The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad**: this is so funny in 2025. but it makes perfect sense - everyone who wants to go into business (whether it's telecom or toasters) should be able to have the chance to succeed. something like that. right now, it's not even remotely the case - we have offshored just about everything to the point that americans are just project managers. even really, really smart ones. then, there's the monopolies. google, facebook, amazon, apple, netflix. they kind of own all the data. the data isn't private and it is in monopoly format. these companies came "first", so they have the first-mover advantage of exclusive rights over the data. imagine if the data was anonymized and public? is that even possible? point is: there shouldn't be such a large barrier to entry as an inability to compete on cost, and an inability to make any inroads because of monopoly power.
    - **The right of every family to a decent home**: Basic shelter. it's 2025. i think we can build homes which provide a decent level of comfort. if you want way more than that, you can pay for it. but at minimum, everyone should be able to have a home with reliable plumbing, heat/AC (through solar. or i should say: "sustainable ways of heating and cooling the home"), electric, clean drinking water, hot water to bathe. there's probably more. americans would flip their shit, but in Estonia they showed what housing was like under communism (NOT A BLANKET APPROVAL OF COMMUNISM. JUST WHAT HOUSING WAS LIKE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT PRIORITIZES BUILDING HOUSING FOR ITS PEOPLE), and it was a nice, comfortable place, and you got to choose from 3-5 options for decorations and entertainment. nobody has everything, but everyone has enough. is that exactly how it went down? no. but the idea of taking care of your people's housing is a good one. you know how to get people off living on the streets? give them housing! nothing is more "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" than not having to worry about where you'll be sleeping tonight. imagine if rather than focusing on where they'd be sleeping and where their next meal is coming from, they could focus on whatever interests them? what if they want to study data science? what if they were good at math, but had to focus on survival? give people the chance to learn what they want
    - **The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health**: So simple and yet so un-American. We really need a channel just to document the absurdities in the american healthcare system. someone needs to write a book. i could do it - it involves Epic, HMOs, deductibles, in-network. There's a story there. i just need to tell it. But, in the real world, it's the ability to go to the hospital when you need to go to the hospital. people don't ~want~ to be in the hospital. stop pricing it like a fucking vacation. there are nurses, doctors, and staff to help keep track of things. we don't need insane middle management "reinvesting" the profits in advertising and stock prices. we need good, quality healthcare. and the ability to have your records securely online without a hospital needing to spend millions on a clunky, code-from-the-70s, EMR system which is more concerned with lobbying the government to keep convoluted regulations than it is providing an intuitive product. i could build a better EMR. i should do that. it's been 2 years since Epic now. The stuff right after Epic is a problem though....
    - **The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment**: Actually, scratch this one: we should be cutting social security and forcing our old and sick to live on the streets! Pull yourself up, lazy grandpa with dementia. this is AMERICA.
    - **The right to a good education.**: Save the best for last. EVERYBODY should want the right to a good education. EVERYBODY benefits from a good education system. You want to start a business and not be in school? Great - you benefit from other people gaining knowledge while you "exploit". It's "explore" vs. "exploit". Business is the "exploiting" of your knowledge. School is "exploring". They go hand-in-hand, and they should be done in waves. You're never done exploring and you're never done exploiting. School is the backbone of any successful society. it's an investment in your people. it's saying: "you'll take the time to practice and learn now, in order to better prepare you to use this to benefit our society later on". Think about if we invested in education for solar energy, IT, plumbing/welding/electrical, data science, humanities, social studies, languages, and so on. it's not impossible, it just takes time to build out. Education, hard skills (like trades, technology), and language studies are vital. Languages allow you to communicate with others, and not look like an idiot who can barely understand English. Everybody else in the world can speak English, and we can only speak English. Think about what an unnecessary hindrance that is: they can communicate with us fully, and they can communicate amongst themselves without us having any idea what they are saying. it's like code breakers in WWII being like "well they aren't speaking ENGLISH so we don't care!" Isn't it better to know what people are saying, to be able to communicate with them? We have the technology, too.

    The last one I'll add for 2025 is: **The right to privacy of your own data**: Because America was first in getting this mass scale technology out, and building an entire economic model based on advertising, we have all had our data sold millions of times over. that means where we go, what we do, what we like, what we look at, is all being mined to provide curated advertisements. However, we have the benefit of knowledge and time now. we know that selling data to the highest bidder isn't an equitable system. We have the ability to secure our data such that you need to opt-in to your data being used for any reason, not the other way around. we need to start with privacy of the person at the heart of building technology, not profit and data mining. a secure and well-thought-out system is a better system. we need to start from scratch (all of our social security numbers are exposed), but we can use the best of what people have created.

    But.... I have no right to talk. i have been doing absolutely nothing for years now. i haven't been living a life i can be proud of. i've been hiding everything, and i haven't been working or contributing in so long. honestly i could argue since 2019/2020, i haven't really been contributing to anything. i have all these incredible talents and interpersonal skills i've been honing for so long, and now it feels like they're all going to waste. it feels like i'm going into halftime with all my timeouts left. that's what it feels like: halftime. There's too much i haven't expereienced yet for this to be the end of the game. i think about time and the movement/passage of time, and which timelines we live in and how each little decision can have an outsized effect. I think about numbers and the meaning of numbers and how they appear in nature. i think about how we live in the world, but i've never done mushrooms? i've never lived off the land? i could live off the land, and then have a computer with internet access and change the world through what i make. i could do it. but i have no credibility. they are all ideas. i need to start from scratch, and just be me. be myself. write the constitution. build the social technology system. do the things i was going to school for, but without school. G-D i wish i had school. for the things i want. social psychology, social systems, technology. I had the perfect program for me and i turned it down. and now i'm here. better make the most of it. for my... kid?

## Data Sovereignty

For some reason, I have become obsessed with the idea of data sovereignty. I think because it's related to technology, governance, personal privacy, and math (encryption). I've never been a government policy person or anything, but data sovereignty is the most important thing when it comes to social data management. We built a system based on novelty and profit, without considering the impact of collecting hoardes of data.

I keep using Estonia as the example here, but there is a lot to consider here. First is the use of blockchain to keep data CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability). The idea, from how I understand it, is that blockchain ledgers use private key cryptography to ensure a transaction is made by you (nobody else could have made the transaction), must be verified independently (do you have the right to make the transaction?), and is extremely difficult to change (once a blockchain is finalized, someone has to change all previous blocks in order to change your transaction). 

I guess the best way to start this is to think of the ideal state. Right now, we need to log in to every single app in the country with a different login, different password, create 2FA for everything. some apps are secure, most apps really are not (seriously - even the banking apps still only have emailed codes as their highest form of security??). The ideal state here is: you login once, you have all the security measures you need for your account, and you can verify who you are once and easily. we're not entering our email, address, credit card info into every site separately. we have it stored in one secure location (with backups and protections in case of theft), and you can use that to verify who you are. What is this for? All government services (or, what should be government services). healthcare - they know who you are and your full history (encrypted so it's not tied to you). education - you can easily apply to programs and have all your information on file. Jobs - you don't need to enter the same information EVERY SINGLE TIME. Even just from a practicality perspective it makes sense. We need to coordinate these. Then, public transit - you have your fare and identification all in the same place. All from your phone (or realistically, if we want to start moving away from phones so our necks stop craning, using VR glasses for things).

The other thing is: maybe you could be the only one to sell your own data? Like, if you want extra money and you are comfortable with less privacy, you could sell certain pieces of data to companies who want to use it to train their models. It's like celebrities with AI - right now, AI is trained on everyone, so you have almost no control over what gets used. What if private people could hold on to everything and not give anything away, but people who are willing to give away a bit of privacy (for money) could do that? Data is currency at this point, but it doesn't feel that way because its already been given away. We had no say in that. Idk. This is a relatively new thought so it may not be fleshed out. I just want data sovereignty and an integrated government with our lives. Right now everything feels so unnecessarily difficult. So kafka-esque.

## Prioritize solar
We know we need energy. We know we need renewable energy. The Trumpian focus on coal is hilarious because it's like saying "let's focus on the least renewable way to get energy, which requires dangerous jobs and slavery to perpetuate, while we have the technology to harness the actual sun, the world's most natural and renewable resource". We need solar so badly - to power our homes and our world. But it takes TIME. We need to build the physical infrastructure (jobs training), the technology behind it (jobs training, security, data management), and probably more. I'm no expert on solar, so I'd defer here. I just know that (1) it's renewable power, and (2) it creates jobs for people.


## Prioritize languages
One of the biggest problems facing the US right now is that we're so insular. Because of our physical isolation and our global domination since WWII, everyone has had to learn English. We've been resting on our laurels for so long, that the entire world has since consumed our media and learned our language. We haven't reciprocated in the slightest. In 2025, the most important skill is the ability to adapt. You can adapt by speaking different languages and understanding different cultures, because it allows you to communicate with different people. You cannot adapt if you only speak one language, and others decide to stop speaking that language. Language learning is a sign of intelligence because it means you're willing to learn. Things have to be right - there are grammar rules and societal norms you need to learn. It's easy to be Trumpy and say "no, we're not going to learn! They need to learn from us!" The problem is... we don't have that power anymore. I could see a US where everyone is multi-lingual, almost to make up for the fact that we've been so isolated for so long. On top of that, we need to encourage TRAVEL! Aussies are everywhere in Europe, even though its a daylong flight to get anywhere. Europeans travel to different countries in the same way we travel to different states. But imagine if, when traveling to different states, you also had to learn a new language to communicate with the people there? Right now, people use English as the common language. So, it's to the US's advantage. But as part of global domination, China is not only exporting their tech - they're exporting their language. What happens if you go to a website in Chinese and can't understand anything? But, they can understand all of your websites? Who's really at the advantage there?
And it's not even just a strategic advantage kind of thing - it's a genuine curiosity. You can't understand another peoples fully if you can't understand what they're saying. It's a part of growth - humbling yourself to learn from others. I say it only in the ether right now (I only speak one language and I could be learning Spanish for real but I only talk about it). I just know it's the right thing to do. We need to prioritize global engagement and languages. Encourage kids after 18 (or before) to travel. Work menial jobs that require you to learn the language and assimilate with another peoples.

## Debt
I need to read David Graeber's book so badly. The current system of debt is beyond anything anyone could've imagined. You will go into debt for any investment into yourself. There's no way to avoid it. Education, healthcare. You'll have to go into insurmountable debt for it. I think there should be a concept of "debt" (maybe put some skin in the game to show you're serious about something), but really it's all about trust and not about keeping somebody in an impossible life situation. I keep thinking about what if we cleared all debt every 7 years? It's a biblical thing, but it makes sense now. 7 years is a long time, to be able to plan, execute, and grow. If you take that 7 years to "explore" (meaning, go to school and improve your skills), you shouldn't really accumulate much debt, but you also won't earn all that much. If you take those 7 years to "exploit" (meaning, start a business. sell something. take a risk), you shouldn't be punished forever if things don't go your way. I think that by cancelling debt, it allows people to take risks they wouldn't take without some security. And when it comes to people working with other people, if someone never pays back and they keep waiting for the reset or whatever, I don't think people will work with them. Just because the debt gets cleared, doesn't mean that person has earned trust. But, it also gives people the ability to earn trust (or to rebuild trust) by showing what you do with the opportunity. I haven't fullly flushed this all out, but i think the idea of debt cancellation is a good one, and would create more pro-social behaviors in the real world.

## Tax System
We need a new tax system. Everyone knows it, but we can create a system of progressive taxation which still incentivizes people to innovate, while also funding social programs. The idea that taxation immediately disincentivizes you to do anything is INSANE. It's this real zero-sum game of "if i can't make all the money i possibly can, i might as well not try". There have to be so many ways to tax in a way that doesn't "insult" the person, and provides enough yearly to fund food, water, healthcare, education, etc... It's just about shrinking the wealth gap. We could do something like 6 tax tiers, people making the most get taxed on each additional dollar above $1,000,000, for example. Here's what ChatGPT gave:

Income Range | Tax Rate
$0 â€“ $10,000 | 10%
$10,001 â€“ $40,000 | 15%
$40,001 â€“ $100,000 | 20%
$100,001 â€“ $250,000 | 25%
$250,001 â€“ $1,000,000 | 35%
$1,000,001 and above | 45%

We could probably do something where it keeps up with inflation, too. The other thing is for people with investment income and not ordinary income, we can tax capital gains and ordinary income as ordinary income. Basically, all income would be taxed the same, whether it comes from a job or investment income. 

I asked ChatGPT what some progressive taxation estimates could bring in, and here's what it says for annual revenue.

Tax Proposal | Estimated Annual Revenue
Warren's Wealth Tax | $270 billion
Biden's Minimum Tax on Wealth over $100M | $50 billion
Modest Progressive Wealth Tax (Study Estimate) | $928.39 billion

It says universal healthcare costs $3.6T annually. This is wild, how are we affording anything? 

Regardless, a progressive tax system is just better. Full stop. It's wild but here are the top marginal tax rates in the period after WWII:

Year | Top Marginal Tax Rate | Applies To Incomes Above (in today's dollars)
1944â€“1945 | 94% | About $2.5 million+ today
1950s (Eisenhower years) | 91% | About $1.6 million+
1963 (last year of this peak) | 91% | Roughly $1.4 million+

Corporate tax rates were also high â€” around 50% to 52% in the 1950s. The effective corporate tax rate (what was actually paid) was around 40%, compared to about 8â€“9% today (according to Chat).

This is crazy - the top marginal income tax rates over time. Fcking Reagan...
